# Privacy Policy for Quick Clipboard

**Effective Date:** February 13, 2026

Quick Clipboard ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension handles your data.

## 1. Overview

Quick Clipboard is a browser extension designed to help you manage your clipboard history locally. We prioritize your privacy by ensuring that your data stays on your device.

## 2. Information We Handle

To provide its core functionality, the extension accesses the following types of information:

- **Clipboard Content:** When you copy text or images (if enabled) while using the extension, the data is captured and added to your local history.
- **Website URLs:** If you use the "Add current URL" feature, the extension records the URL of the page you are currently visiting.

## 3. Local Storage Only

**All data captured by Quick Clipboard is stored locally on your device** using Chrome's `storage.local` API.

- We **do not** collect, store, or transmit your data to any external servers.
- We **do not** have access to your clipboard history or any personal information.

## 4. No Data Sharing

Since your data never leaves your device, we do not share, sell, or trade your personal information or clipboard history with any third parties.

## 5. User Control and Data Deletion

You have full control over your data:

- You can view and manage your history within the extension overlay.
- You can clear your entire history by removing the extension or clearing the extension's local storage in your browser settings.
- Uninstalling the extension automatically deletes all data stored by Quick Clipboard on your device.

## 6. Permissions Justification

- **storage:** Used to save your clipboard history locally on your device.
- **clipboardRead / clipboardWrite:** Used to capture new items and allow you to copy previous items back to your clipboard.
- **contextMenus:** Used to provide a manual "Add to Clipboard" option via the right-click menu.
